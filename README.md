# BASH-Tutorial
vim configuration file + bash scripts i created in learning process

If you wish to use my VIM configuration file, copy ".vimrc" to your **home** directory.
I recommend going through "vimtutor" first and reviewing the insides of the configuration file.

You can launch vimtutor with the following command in terminal:
~~~
vimtutor
~~~

# Installation
**NB!** Clone the project to "/git/" directory created in your **home directory**
Some scripts search for files/directories in:
~~~

~~~
